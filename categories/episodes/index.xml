      <description>&lt;p&gt;The episode begins with Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum walking and looking for a flower called a Weeping Willy. Once they find it, they start collecting its tears, when Clone James fakes his death claiming that the ground below Bubblegum is loose and performs a fake attempt to save her. He falls into the river and yells, &amp;ldquo;Remember me!&amp;rdquo;. A flashback is shown of the occurrences of the episode &amp;rdquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/James&#34;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Finn and Jake feel sorry for him, pointing out that it was the 25th time James had sacrificed himself for Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum then tells them that James faked his death, and points out that the ground near the flower is perfectly solid, and there is no possibility of her falling into the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;test&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn and Jake then tell her to bring him back by cloning him, but she tells them that the fake deaths are getting out of hand and it is pointless to award him for his foolish behavior. She says that it&amp;rsquo;s time for him to go into an eternal nap. Finn and Jake protest against her and persuade her to bring him back, but she stands on her ground and declares that there would be no more Jameses. She then tells Finn and Jake to clean up James&amp;rsquo;s apartment to which they reluctantly agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they make their way to his apartment, they start talking about his &amp;lsquo;sacrifices&amp;rsquo;, like eating a contaminated cupcake for PB. When they reach the apartment, open the door and switch on the lights they are surprised to find lots of Jameses and ask them who&amp;rsquo;s in charge. A clone James comes forward wearing a lot of medals and introduces himself as James #2. They ask him to explain the scene, to which he replies he was lonely, and wanted more companionship. He knew PB wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make another James, unless he died a hero, so he started faking his death to collect medals, saying that medals make him happy. Jake tells Finn that Princess would be upset about this, to which James #2 gets scared and tells them not to convey this to her. He also tries to bribe them by giving them a medal, but the duo refuse. They say that they won&amp;rsquo;t warn the Princess, because she will eventually find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn and Jake go outside and then sit on a bench, laughing at the scene. After some time, they see the Princess whistling and going to James&amp;rsquo; apartment. As soon as Princess enters the building, she shouts, &amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo; and all of the Jameses start running out of the house to random places. Finn and Jake enjoy it and laugh. The scene then changes and shows the original James and other Goo Monsters heading out of the pit and towards the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene then returns to the Candy Kingdom, showing Finn and Jake sitting on the walls of the kingdom, and looking below. They see the Princess assembling the Banana Guards and showing them a picture of James. The Banana Guards understand, but as soon as Princess says there are 25 of them, the Banana Guards get all confused and ask questions, such as &amp;ldquo;How can one picture identify all 25?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Are they brothers?&amp;rdquo; Princess Bubblegum angrily answers their questions. Finn and Jake laugh at their stupidity, when PB notices them and asks for their help. They invite her to their place, and she goes along, while muttering. She arrives at their place, and asks why they are sitting down doing nothing. Jake tells her to sit for 5 minutes and enjoy it. She sits down, and Jake offers her some wall candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They look below as a Clone James comes to their place. The Banana Guards don&amp;rsquo;t identify him, and even ask him if he has seen the James in the picture. Even Clone James couldn&amp;rsquo;t identify himself which causes the three watching from above to laugh. Eventually, all the Jameses try and cannot identify their own picture. The Banana Guard in charge takes the photo back and asks the name of the first Clone James. He then asks all their names and all of them claim to be &amp;lsquo;James&amp;rsquo;, and say that their names are the same, &amp;ldquo;because they look alike.&amp;rdquo; The Banana Guard then comes to a random conclusion that they are brothers, to which the Jameses reply otherwise. The Banana Guard counts them but the Clone Jameses reassures that there are 25 of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Banana Guard then puts his mental power to work and recalls the orders of PB. He then tells his other guards that they are the guys Princess was talking about.They finally try to capture them while Finn, Jake, and PB laugh at this. The scene then changes to the Banana Guards randomly trying to capture all the Jameses, and in the end, they manage to capture them all. While all this is happening, the Original James and the horde of Goo Monsters arrive at Candy Kingdom, unnoticed. Princess Bubblegum arrives at the place where all Jameses are captured, and snatches their medals, saying they are not heroes. Suddenly, a Gumball Guardian shouts, &amp;ldquo;Evil presence detected!&amp;rdquo; and points to the horde of Goo Monsters. The Banana Guards are then ordered to protect the Candy Kingdom. They obey the order, but since they don&amp;rsquo;t usually fight, some fake their death and one even jabs a spear into his body to fake it. Finn intervenes and uses the spear to attack the Monsters, but on contact with their bodies, the spear melts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn then warns everyone not to touch them, as anything that touches them melts. The Banana Guards get scared and run into the kingdom. Finn notices some Candy Orphans playing there. He asks Jake for help to bring them inside the kingdom. As they get busy with this task, the Jameses notice PB in danger. They notice the Original James attacking her, and then try to save her by dogpiling on him and fusing together. This causes the Original James to be fused with the clones and be killed. The Jameses say, &amp;ldquo;We told you we were heroes!&amp;rdquo;. Afterwards, Princess Bubblegum awards the medals back to the Jameses. She then gives them a new assignment, which is to &amp;ldquo;go to the wasteland and never come back.&amp;rdquo; The Jameses protest, but Princess Bubblegum interrupts them and tells them she would send them a medal every day. They agree to this and run to the wasteland. The episode ends with Princess Bubblegum saying, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna miss him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Escape from the Citadel (Season 6)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Finn&#34;&gt;Finn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jake&#34;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt; hitch a ride on a Citadel Guardian after he imprisons and transports &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lich_(character)&#34;&gt;The Lich&lt;/a&gt; to the Citadel. Upon arrival, the Guardian attaches The Lich&amp;rsquo;s crystal prison onto a much larger crystal &amp;ldquo;cell block.&amp;rdquo; Finn then says it is a good riddance for The Lich. As they talk, The Lich begins emitting a gray breath in his cell which the duo don&amp;rsquo;t notice. Finn and Jake then look around for Finn&amp;rsquo;s long-lost father, whom Finn initially suggests might be a Guardian. Jake points out a strange looking &amp;ldquo;old kid&amp;rdquo; who resembles Finn, and it turns out to be Finn&amp;rsquo;s father incarcerated inside a crystal jail cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn runs to his dad and looks him closely. A gray slime fire forms on Finn&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s cell, which makes Finn hyper about it and asks Jake about the fire. Jake then points above from where the fire had fallen on the cell. They then notice that the Lich&amp;rsquo;s cell is excreting a gray slime that is beginning to infect the other prisoners and making them under the influence of The Lich. The cell of Finn&amp;rsquo;s father then melts and his father half inside the cell asks Finn for help. Finn uses Jake as flail to break him out of the cell. The Lich&amp;rsquo;s influence over the Citadel enables a massive jailbreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn&amp;rsquo;s father then asks him about the &amp;ldquo;starskipper&amp;rdquo; from which they came, completely ignoring the fact that there is another human in his presence. The prisoners are running amok and attacking the Guardians and making each other gray. After Jake says that Finn is his son, Finn&amp;rsquo;s father is still not surprised by it and starts telling them to find a way to escape. Finn starts to ask his father why he abandoned him, but before he could do, his father jumps in the center of the Citadel, as the ground was melting. Finn again begins to ask him but is cut in middle as a dead guardian pushes them even further. They reach a solid ground and Jake gets frightened by the happenings around him. One of the prisoners is a void caster, who has the power to open portals, so he uses his power to attack a guardian by opening a void in front of a train that &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Starchie&#34;&gt;Starchie&lt;/a&gt; is driving in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Candy_Kingdom&#34;&gt;Candy Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, which crashes into a guardian and kills the guardian. Finn calms Jake down and says to just hijack a floating piece of the Citadel some other Ancients were hijacking and go off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn&amp;rsquo;s father then tells Jake to smarten up and as he was saying, the last Guardian who was dying shoots a beam that hits Finn&amp;rsquo;s father in the lower right shin, which obliterates all the flesh from a segment of his leg, leaving the bones. Finn starts to panic but his father, who introduces him as &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Martin&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; says that the Guardian&amp;rsquo;s blood has healing properties, and asks Finn to bring it. Finn but puts his question why he was abandoned in the woods, which Martin doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember. He just tells Finn to bring the blood of guardian first. Jake shape-shifts himself into a bridge, enabling Finn to retrieve the regenerative guardian blood and put it on Martin&amp;rsquo;s leg, which is quickly restored to a healthy state. While this is happening, Jake points out to Finn that the Lich came out of the swamp. Finn calls for Martin, who had fled with the other prisoners, abandoning Finn once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cell of The Lich bursts and he commands Finn and Jake to fall, which makes them go unconscious. The Lich then entrances Finn, telling him that there is only darkness in his life and only death will be imminent for all life and that he is all alone in the world now. Jake appears unconscious next to Finn. Finn feebly attempts to strike the Lich as he encroaches. His attack was ineffective, but there was some guardian blood near him. The Lich approaches for Finn and as soon as he was to touch, Finn&amp;rsquo;s hand, which was dipped in some guardian blood near him touched the Lich which causes the Lich to scream as flesh begins to grows on his bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn then wakes from his trance and throws more guardian blood onto The Lich, restoring more flesh around his chest. Finn then tells Jake to finish him off while he chases after his father. Martin goes to the other prisoners and persuades them to make him their leader, to which they agree. He makes a creature to cut the stem before Finn reaches him. But as soon as the creature cuts the stem, Finn holds the cut end of the stem from both sides. This causes Martin to panic and at Martin&amp;rsquo;s request, the fugitive void caster creates a void to escape into, which begins to suck the floating chunk of land upward faster. Finn grabs the two halves of the severed stem tighter and preventing his father from leaving, telling he won&amp;rsquo;t let him escape and he struggles to hold on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jake tells Finn to let it go, calling Martin a loser but Finn refuses and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Grass_Sword&#34;&gt;Grass Sword&lt;/a&gt; takes over Finn&amp;rsquo;s right arm, allowing him one last tremendous pull. Martin grosses out at this and asks the void caster to enlarge the void. This causes much pressure on Finn&amp;rsquo;s hand and at last, Finn&amp;rsquo;s arm gives out and is severed from his body, while Martin states &amp;ldquo;Wait, what about air—&amp;rdquo; right before escaping through the portal. Finn falls into the water below where a small piece of Guardian blood touches his arm, making the stump of an arm sprout a flower. Jake pulls Finn to shore where &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Shelby&#34;&gt;Shelby&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to have been hiding out the entire time. Shelby then sits on Finn&amp;rsquo;s lap while crying. Finn is reminded of the Lich and asks Jake if he finished him off. Jake says there&amp;rsquo;s no need, as the Guardian blood transformed the Lich into a baby-like creature, who is seemingly cute and harmless. Finn, Jake, Shelby, and the infant Lich return to the Candy Kingdom by way of the portal that Starchie drove through during the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Tree_Trunks_(character)&#34;&gt;Tree Trunks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Pig&#34;&gt;Mr. Pig&lt;/a&gt; are sitting in her house when outside Finn and Jake&amp;rsquo;s chatter can be heard. The doorbell rings, interrupting a somber Tree Trunks saying, &amp;ldquo;I think we should get a d—.&amp;rdquo; The couple sees outside their door an infant Lich in a stereotypical abandoned-baby basket. Tree Trunks looks excited and implies that this sudden addition to their family has changed her feeling about whatever she was about to say. The infant Lich suddenly says, &amp;ldquo;Hello!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
